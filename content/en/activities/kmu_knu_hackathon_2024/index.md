Participated in a hackathon under the theme of developing software/app solutions for challenges faced by ventures and startups.

We developed and presented a B2B service called **"Will You Review?"**, which uses AI to encourage users to write product reviews and enhance their quality, ultimately supporting corporate marketing efforts.  
The project was awarded the **Gold Prize**.
