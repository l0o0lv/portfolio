Participated in a hackathon under the theme of developing services to bridge the digital divide caused by factors such as age, gender, and education.

We developed a marketing platform for small business owners to help reduce the digital gap between traditional markets and large retailers, enabling local merchants to engage more actively in the online marketplace.
